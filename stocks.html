<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Stocks</h1>
<p> When you buy stock of a company you become an owner of the company. Now, unless you own 20% or more
of the company you do not make any power over the company. However, what you do get is either the stock
pays dividends and/or increases in value. Hopefully, all of your stock will increase in value but not all
stocks pay dividends. Dividends are the extra income the company makes. They give stockholders a portion of
the income. However, instead of paying out dividends the company may reinvest into the company which is also
a good thing. Thats because the company will grow and make more money, and your stock will increase in worth.
But, if a company files for bankruptcy you will lose all your stocks and get nothing in return.
