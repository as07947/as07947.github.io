<p>Bonds are documents that are sold by a company, or goverenment in order to raise money.
In other words the company barrows your money with a promise to pay it back with interest.
A bondholder will buy the bond and in return the company will pay interest on the bond. The interest rate will be printed on
the bond along with a maturity date. Let's say that the interest rate of a bond is 6%, but the market rate
drops to 5%. The company still has to pay you the interest at the 6% rate because it is on the bond.
When the bond matures the company will pay back the amount the bondholder
originaly paid for the bond. However, it can take 15 to 20 years for a bond to mature.
