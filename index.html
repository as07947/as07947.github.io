<p> As a student money is hard to come by and very easily spent. However, if you save money little by little
you can turn that saved money into an investment. An investment will grow far faster than just letting 
your money sit in a savings account. When your money is in a savings account it won't grow because the
bank doesn't give you a interest payment that matches the inflaction rate. So if you keep your money in
in the bank it will be worth less over time. If you invest your money in either stocks or bonds your money
will grow and will be worth much more over time.</p>
